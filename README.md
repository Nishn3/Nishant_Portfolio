# [Project 1: Fake News Detection](https://github.com/Nishn3/CodeClause-Fake-News-Detection)

* In this project, I focused on fake news detection using Python and the Visual Code Studio IDE. The goal was to build a machine-learning model to classify news articles as real or fake based on their content. 
* Leveraging Python and popular libraries like pandas, numpy, and sci-kit-learn, I handled the data, performed preprocessing, and implemented the machine learning algorithm. By utilizing TF-IDF vectorization, I transformed the textual data into numerical features and trained a PassiveAggressiveClassifier model. 
* To evaluate the model's accuracy, I employed metrics such as accuracy score, precision, recall, and F1 score. These metrics provided valuable insights into the model's performance. 
* Additionally I also generated insightful graphs, including a confusion matrix, to further analyze the model's predictions. The confusion matrix visually represents the model's predictions against the actual labels of the news articles, allowing for the identification of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. 
* I implemented this project in the VS Code IDE, which provided the advantage of free access to GPU and TPU resources, enabling faster computation for machine learning tasks.
